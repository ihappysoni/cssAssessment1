  <h3 class="red">What is CSS?</h3>
  <ol type="1" class="brown">
      <li>CSS standfs for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
      <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
      <li><span id="cut"> CSS is not necessary</span> <span id="bg"><b>CSS saves a lot of work.</b> </span> It can control the layout multiple webpage all at once</li>
      <li id="unl" >External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li>
  </ol>  
  <h3 class="red">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
  <ul type="disc" class="brown">
      <li>Inline - by using style attribute inside HTML elements.</li>
      <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section.</li>
      <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external file.</li>
      <li>The most common way to add CSS , is to keep the styles in external CSS Files. However, <span id="bg"><b>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</b> </span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for youto try it yourself.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="brown">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference in that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one one umique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to linkk directly to an element and it's use by JavaScript</p>
  <p class="brown">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targetted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
  <p class="brown">There are the wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
